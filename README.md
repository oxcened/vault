### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- 📦 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Vault uses `npm@10.9.2`)
- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (If you want to use the included DB spin up script)

### Spin up the dev server

Here’s what you need to do to get started quickly:

1. **Clone the project**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oxcened/vault.git
   cd vault
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** using the provided example:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Generate an authentication secret**:

   ```sh
   npx auth secret
   ```

   Open `.env`, locate the `AUTH_SECRET` field, and paste the generated secret.

4. **Set up Discord authentication**:

   1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   2. Create a new application.
   3. Under **OAuth2**, add a redirect URI matching:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord
   ```

   4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the OAuth2 settings.
   5. In your `.env` file, paste them in `AUTH_DISCORD_ID` and `AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET`.

5. **Configure the database**:

   - Fill `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` with your database connection details.
   - If you don’t have a database, run:
     ```sh
     ./start-database.sh
     ```
     _(Requires Docker to be installed)_

6. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

7. **Apply migrations and generate the Prisma client**:

   ```sh
   npm run db:generate
   ```

8. **Run the app**:
   ```sh

## 🧠 Reactive Architecture

This app uses a fully reactive, event-driven architecture to keep derived financial data accurate and efficient. Here's how it works:

### Event-Driven Data Flow

Whenever core data changes — like assets, debts, transactions, stock prices, or exchange rates — the system emits events that represent **facts** about what happened. These events are handled by dedicated listeners that determine whether and how to trigger updates to derived data.

**Example event types:**

- `asset:updated`
- `debt:updated`
- `transaction:updated`
- `exchangeRate:updated`
- `stockPrice:updated`

### Derived Data & Smart Recomputes

Derived data (like Net Worth or Cash Flow) is not recomputed blindly. Instead:

- **Shared data changes** (e.g. stock prices, exchange rates) trigger recomputes **only for affected snapshots**, based on a `DerivedDataDependency` table.
- **User-specific changes** (assets, debts, transactions) use smart recompute functions like:
  - `recomputeNetWorthForUserFrom(...)`
  - `recomputeCashFlowForUserFrom(...)`

These functions only recompute data from the earliest relevant timestamp forward.

### Dependency Graph

Every derived data snapshot tracks the specific inputs it used:

- Exchange rates
- Stock prices

This allows:

- ✅ Precise invalidation when inputs change
- ✅ No over-computation
- ✅ Full traceability of what influenced what
